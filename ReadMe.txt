*Special Note:

As of right now (9/20) everything is written in SQLite as opposed to regular
SQL because I don't have SQL Express on my computer right now.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

The biggest difference so far seems to be in
concatenation b/c SQL has a CONCAT function and uses + whereas SQLite
just uses SELECT and ||.
